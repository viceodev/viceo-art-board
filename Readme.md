## Welcome to My World!

Hahaha, I am just playing around. This is a personal Project that was inspired by a need. Yes, I wanted to have a personal utility tool where I could scribble my signature on and download with ease. This want or need - which ever you call it- gave birth to this project.

I learnt a lot about the Canvas API which is the core tool this was built on.

At the current stage of this little web app you;
1. Scribble drawing on the canvas.
2. Change the color of the brush.
3. Change the kind of brush you use to give you a different paint feel.
4. Erase from design
5. Download Design as image [png, jpeg]
