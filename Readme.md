## Welcome to My World (In a spooky voice 😂)!

Hahaha, I am just playing around. 

This is a personal Project that was inspired by a need. I wanted to have a personal utility tool where I could scribble my signature on and download with ease. This want or need - i am still confused what it is😂 - gave birth to this project.

I learnt a lot about the Canvas API which is the core tool this was built on.

At the current stage of this little web app you can;
1. Scribble drawings on the canvas.
2. Change the color of the brush.
3. Change the kind of brush you use to give you a different paint feel.
4. Erase from the design.
5. Download your Design as image [png, jpeg].

I found this project super interesting.
